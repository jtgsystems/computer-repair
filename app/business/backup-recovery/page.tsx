              <AccordionItem value="item-1">
                <AccordionTrigger>How often should Toronto businesses back up their data?</AccordionTrigger>
                <AccordionContent>
                  The frequency of backups depends on how often your data changes and how much data loss your Toronto
                  business can tolerate. For many GTA businesses, we recommend daily backups of critical data. However,
                  for systems with frequent changes, such as those in Toronto's financial district, we might implement
                  continuous data protection for real-time backups. We'll work with you to determine the optimal backup
                  schedule for your specific needs in Toronto's dynamic business environment.

              <AccordionItem value="item-2">
                <AccordionTrigger>How long does data recovery typically take for a Toronto business?</AccordionTrigger>
                <AccordionContent>
                  Recovery time can vary depending on the amount of data and the nature of the disaster. For small
                  amounts of data or single-file recoveries, we can often restore data within minutes. For larger
                  recoveries, it might take several hours. In cases of complete system failure, recovery could take a
                  day or more. We prioritize critical systems and data to minimize business disruption in Toronto's
                  fast-paced market. Our goal is always to get you operational as quickly as possible to maintain your
                  competitive edge in the GTA.

                  Is our backed-up data secure in the cloud, considering Toronto's cybersecurity landscape?
                </AccordionTrigger>
                <AccordionContent>
                  Yes, we take extensive measures to ensure the security of your cloud-based backups, especially
                  considering the unique cybersecurity challenges in Toronto. All data is encrypted both in transit and
                  at rest using industry-standard encryption protocols. We use reputable cloud providers with data
                  centers in and around Toronto, ensuring multiple layers of physical and digital security.
                  Additionally, we implement strict access controls to ensure only authorized personnel can access your
                  backups. Regular security audits are conducted to maintain the highest level of protection for your
                  data, in compliance with Toronto and Ontario data protection regulations.
