          <AccordionItem value="item-1">
            <AccordionTrigger>How often should we conduct security assessments?</AccordionTrigger>
            <AccordionContent>
              We recommend conducting comprehensive security assessments at least annually, with more frequent
              vulnerability scans performed quarterly or monthly, depending on your risk profile and industry
              requirements. However, cybersecurity should be an ongoing process with continuous monitoring and updates.

          <AccordionItem value="item-2">
            <AccordionTrigger>What should we do if we suspect a security breach?</AccordionTrigger>
            <AccordionContent>
              If you suspect a security breach, it's crucial to act quickly. Contact our incident response team
              immediately. In the meantime, isolate affected systems if possible, but do not turn them off as this can
              lead to loss of valuable forensic data. Document everything you observe, and avoid making changes to the
              system until our team arrives.

          <AccordionItem value="item-3">
            <AccordionTrigger>How can we train our employees in cybersecurity best practices?</AccordionTrigger>
            <AccordionContent>
              Employee training is a critical component of any cybersecurity strategy. We offer comprehensive security
              awareness training programs that can be tailored to your organization. These include online courses,
              simulated phishing exercises, in-person workshops, and regular updates on new threats. We recommend
              conducting training sessions at least annually, with more frequent updates for high-risk roles.
